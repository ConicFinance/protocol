# Conic

The Conic protocol introduces Conic Omnipools, which allocate liquidity in a single asset across multiple Curve pools, giving Conic liquidity providers (LPs) exposure to multiple Curve pools through a single LP token. All Curve LP tokens are automatically staked on Convex to earn CVX and CRV rewards. Additionally, Conic LPs receive CNC, the ERC20 Conic DAO token. Liquidity in an Omnipool is allocated to Curve pools based on target allocation weights, which get updated regularly through a liquidity allocation vote held by the vote-locked CNC holders.

For a more detailed overview of the protocol please refer to the docs (https://docs.conic.finance/).
